Getting to this point felt like a long time coming for me. Whether overly ambitious or just having difficulty making the time to work through the curriculum at a pace that would push my comfort level, but still retain the necessary information to progress. I've always tried to set ambitious goals for myself and when I started this journey I expected to have blown right past this point in a couple of months...that didn't happen.

However, when I look back on this project and how the time spent working through the curriculum I think I've ultimately landed in a place where I can feel confident and comfortable writing my own code, as well as interpreting other people's code. In fact, it has already started to become a bigger part of my day-to-day role at work. But I digress.

The hardest part (aside from the trial and error of scraping the websites) was actually deciding what to build. I knew that movie listings, restauarants, music library and kickstarter gems were off the table. I wanted to build something unique anyway. Something where I would have to really push myself to build this on my own without being able to look back at past labs.

So I settled on a Podcast Gem and as a long time listener and contributor of WNYC, as well as a subscriber of many of their podcasts I knew exactly where to go to find content to scrape for my gem.

This gem will present the user with a list of podcasts produced by NPR scraped from their podcast directory. It will prompt the user to enter a number associated to a podcast they are most interested to learn more where they will be given a description for the podcast, latest episode title, date published and show teaser.

As most of the students at Flatiron can likely attest Avi has one saying that he says a lot - "Write the code I wish I had." I'll confess I didn't fully understand this until this project.

Staring at a blank screen I thought to myself, "wouldn't it be great if I had a file structure to begin working from..." Type 'bundle gem podcast' and I was off and running.

After I created a new repository on GitHub and made my first commits it was time to start working on my program. I started by updating the README.md and adding my NOTES.md files to the project as one small step before I got to into the actual programming, because that was the easiest part.

I began by creating the CLI class with 3 basic methods #call #list_podcasts and #menu. Using static data of what I wanted the methods to return it became fairly easy to stub out a few methods and a semi-functional program.

As I continued to progress through the lab I found myself extending functionality of methods, builiding new classes, breaking and fixing my program. It was really fun! I started to lose track of time and found myself obssessing over minute details about how my program was operating...still am if I'm being completely honest. I also tried to keep each method and class as abstract as possible with the intent of possibly adding othere resources for which to encapsulate to a more complete list of podcasts a user could search, discover and experience.

This project (albeit daunting) was some of the most fun I've had yet on this journey to become a programmer. Each time I found myself frustrated and confused I pressed on, searched more and ultimately found the solutions to my troubles. All this has given me a big boost of confidence and something I'm looking forward to building on as I work towards my new project.
