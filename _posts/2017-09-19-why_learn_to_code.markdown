If I've read one post about learning to code I feel like I've read them all (or at least a significant majority). They all tend to follow a similar format.

* Talk about how prevailent coding is our society today
* Describe how today's reality will only be furthered as we progress into the future whereby signalling to the reader to potential value of learning to code
* Present some data to reinforce the value of coding and allude to why the reader should consider learning
* Then try to leave the reader with some resources or tips on where they can get started

This is all well and good, but for me it goes much deeper. I've worked at startups now for the better part of 8 years and picked up a few things along the way that have served me well in my current role of selling advertising technology to publishers. I firmly believe that my inclination towards coding and insatiable curiousity for the engineering side of the business gave me a definite advantage over competing companies, as well as enhanced my value to both the prospect and my current employer.

Now, I'm sure I could've continued forward in my current role and done just fine. Picking up bits and pieces of knowledge as I went along at work while finding the time to learn more coding principals at home through various free resources online without taking the plunge into a program like Flatiron School. But this all felt a little to ambiguous for me. I wanted a more defined path. Something that didn't feel so much like I was only scratching the surface of my true potential.

Finally, I said enough is enough. It's time to stop with the worrying. Talking yourself into it then immediately out of it. Now is the time. So here we are and here I am. The beginnings of my journey from Sales to becoming a Full Stack Developer.
