Since joining Flatiron School I've been really excited and anxious to jump into the code, complete the labs as quickly as possible (when possible) and continue moving towards my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.

What I've neglected to do is to keep up with the blogging sessions, so here goes.

It's been a little over 3 months now since I started this journey and I'll be honest. I thought I'd be a lot further than I am right now. Not just "thought," but expected. **Coding really is hard**, especially when trying to balance against many other elements of daily life that are constantly competing for attention.

But I made a decision and a commitment to code. Immersing myself in code as part of the learning experience and **now is the time**. I'm going to continue to press on. Seek help when I need it and maybe a little earlier than I typically have. I'm going to try to engage this community more often to help continue to push me towards my goal, and also keep me accountable.
