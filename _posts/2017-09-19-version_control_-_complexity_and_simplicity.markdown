As I work through the Git labs I'm constantly drawing parallels to the complexity created by many of the folks I work with or have worked with in the past and I wonder how it all could be different if more people knew basic principles of version controll and/or  better methods and tools to do so.

#### Here's a quick example.

For context, I work in sales for an advertising technology company where we provide tools to help websites monetize their audience. As part of our process we tend to collaborate frequently on pitch decks, proposals and revenue projections. We tend to use Google's suite of products as they are definitely better than their Microsoft competitors (in my opinion) at handling/enabling collaboration within a single document. I imagine this is pretty standard for most organizations, particularly startups.

As I read through the labs on *Version Control* I kept thinking about how these principals could be applied to my current role and team to make us far more efficient in how we work, stay on task with the intended outcome of a closed deal on an expedited timeline. Which I think can be said of any sales team or manager's desire.

Let's take this a step further and I'll attempt to draw direct parallels to what I'm referring in the sales process and how version control could be applied.

First, I'm going to assume that the sale itself and thus our product is going to be equivalent to our master directory creating a timeline equivalency to version control within programming. So the master repo is going to be the company and it's product we currently offer today. Day 1 of the sales process and in some ways the cold call.

As we begin the sales process we start to create features of the master directory effectively selling the value of our offering to the customer. As we continue to build these different features we may find bugs arise in the currnet product that must be addresssed. A bug in this case could be something like we've neglected to map ourselves a key influencer of the evaluation that could ruin the features (aka relationships in this example) we're building in parallel.

Now these two things may not align, but it's up to me as the seller to effectively merge the two into a cohesive product with great new features.

Rather than go too deep here I'm going to pull back and also mention that I see direct applications for how we work with documents, particularly PowerPoint as another component that could use version control to make us more efficient, but based on my experiences this is not a practice commonly familiar with sales folks...but I'd argue now that it probably should.
